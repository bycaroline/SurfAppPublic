                        <p>Knäbäckshusen is located on the east coast of southern Sweden and is well-known by surfers
                            in the area as a spot that at times can deliver great surfing conditions, for being in the
                            Baltic Sea. </p>

                        <p>Since the Baltic Sea is rather narrow, the only times surf conditions can be
                            favorable in Knäbäckshusen is when the wind is onshore for some time and then, either
                            shifts to offshore, or decreases drastically. As expected this happens very rarely and in
                            order to be able to spot such an instance one must constantly be monitoring surfing apps.
                            By subscribing for this app you will be notified one day in advance for when surf might be
                            favorable at Knäbäckshusen. </p>
